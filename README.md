# QuantumPython

_[DISCLAIMER]: This project is very much experimental, so please DO NOT use this language for any serious quantum programming._<br/>
_[WARNING]: This code is a major work in progress, so the features of this language may change often._

QuantumPython is an experimental high-level quantum programming language that aims to represent quantum constructs in a classical way. This is a python library that uses IBM's qiskit library to compile the quantum component of the code file into quantum circuits, so it can represent both pure-quantum and hybrid algorithms.

## Documentation

Documentation is contained within the file DOC.md, please read that!

## Installation

To install, clone the repository to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://BlueTot/QuantumPython
```

To use the library, place the libary file `qython.py` in the **same** directory as your code file

To use the features provided in the documentation, import the feature from the libary `qython`

```python
from qython import qsv
```
