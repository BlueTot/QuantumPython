# QuantumPython

_[DISCLAIMER]: This project is very much experimental, so please DO NOT use this language for any serious quantum programming._<br/>
_[WARNING]: This code is a major work in progress, so the features of this language may change often._

QuantumPython is an experimental high-level quantum programming language that aims to represent quantum constructs in a classical way. This is an extension of normal python (but not a library!) that uses IBM's qiskit library to compile quantum code into quantum circuits.

## Data Types

The following quantum data types are supported:

  `qsv`: A quantum integer (register)<br/>
  `qconst`: A quantum constant

## Measurement

## Conditional Logic

## Quantum Functions

## Entanglement
